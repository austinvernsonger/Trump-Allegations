# COI - **That Virginia Vineyard**

Among the dozens of properties President-elect Donald Trump owns is Trump Vineyard Estates and Winery in Charlottesville, Virginia, the source of his namesake wine. Since Trump was elected, the property has requested temporary H-2A visas for six foreign workers,[according to_The Washington Post_](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/trump-vineyard-seeks-labor-department-approval-to-hire-foreign-workers/2016/12/22/f320bea8-c86a-11e6-8bee-54e800ef2a63_story.html?utm_term=.4b5cc33e311f). The visas,[which are administered by the Citizenship and Immigration Services wing of the Department of Homeland Security](https://www.uscis.gov/working-united-states/temporary-workers/h-2a-temporary-agricultural-workers#Employment-Related), allow businesses to temporarily hire foreign, unskilled workers provided that the employer proves that there are not enough domestic candidates to fulfill a one-time or seasonal shortage and that the hiring will not depress wages for U.S.-born employees. Trump, of course, will be in charge of appointing a new Secretary of Homeland Security once he assumes the presidency, which gives Trump authority over the very department responsible for deciding whether to grant the visas that the vineyard has requested. His current nominee, retired general John Kelly,[has a relatively scant track record when it comes to immigration](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/retired-marine-gen-john-f-kelly-picked-to-head-department-of-homeland-security/2016/12/07/165472f2-bbe6-11e6-94ac-3d324840106c_story.html?utm_term=.3cba26b87900), leaving open the question of how much influence Trump himself will have over the DHS’s policy on the matter.

On top of the fact that Trump will soon be able to influence the outcome of the request, that his organization has continued to request visas after his election underscores a tension in the president-elect’s stance on immigration. From the moment that he announced that he would be running for president, Trump made antagonism toward immigration the central aspect of his campaign, arguing that both legal and illegal immigrants are taking jobs that should be filled by native-born Americans and depressing wages for others. Though he did not specifically single out the H-2B visa, the president-elect has on multiple occasions[spoken critically about the H-1B program](http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2016/03/04/donald-trump-says-hes-changing-on-h-1b-visas/), which enables employers to temporarily hire foreign workers for skilled jobs like those in the tech industry.

  
But the Trump Organization has long been a beneficiary of immigrant labor. For example, according to a [_Reuters_](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-trump-exclusive-idUSKCN0Q62RQ20150802) report from August 2015, nine companies of which Trump is the majority owner have requested at least 1,100 foreign visas since 2000. The majority of these requests were from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club in Florida, which has requested at least 787 foreign visas since 2006, including 70 applications in 2015. \(Meanwhile, [_The New York Times_reported](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/26/us/politics/donald-trump-taps-foreign-work-force-for-his-florida-club.html?_r=2) that, since 2010, only 17 of the nearly 300 domestic applicants for positions at the Mar-a-Lago have been hired.\) The Trump Organization also famously may have benefited from illegal immigration: [There is significant evidence](http://time.com/4465744/donald-trump-undocumented-workers/) that many of the Polish construction workers at the Trump Tower construction site in New York in 1980 were in the country illegally. In other words, Trump’s track record includes not just taking advantage of the very visa process he claims to abhor but also actually subverting existing law for his own profit. Now, by applying for visas for his vineyard, Trump is signaling that he expects that his business will continue to be able to profit from one of the very immigration programs he continually denounces.

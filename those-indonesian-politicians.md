# COI - Those Indonesian Politicians

Despite President-elect Donald Trump’s[assurance that he has stopped pursuing deals since the election](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/us/politics/donald-trump-postpones-announcement-on-business-conflicts.html), his namesake organization is currently moving forward with a pair of projects in Indonesia.[According to_The New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/asia/indonesia-donald-trump-resort.html?_r=1), the two properties that will bear the Trump name, one overlooking a Hindu temple in Bali and the other abutting a theme park in West Java, presented ethical problems even before the election.

To begin with, through his Indonesian partner on the projects, the billionaire media mogul Hary Tanoesoedibjo \(known in Indonesia as Hary Tanoe\), Trump has forged relationships with several top Indonesian politicians. One such leader is Setya Novanto, the speaker of the country’s House of Representatives who[temporarily lost his post](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/world/asia/indonesia-freeport-mcmoran-setya-novanto.html?_r=1)for trying to extort $4 billion from the American mining company Freeport-McMoRan \(a company which counts Carl Icahn,[who will be serving as a special adviser in Trump’s administration](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/21/us/politics/peter-navarro-carl-icahn-trump-china-trade.html), among its largest shareholders, and which has been[frequently criticized by labor advocates and environmentalists](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/27/world/asia/below-a-mountain-of-wealth-a-river-of-waste.html?_r=0)\). Trump had lunch with Novanto and several other Indonesian politicians during the campaign in September 2015 to discuss the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia.[At a post-luncheon press conference](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbCBFRVcii4&feature=youtu.be), Trump pulled Novanto in front of the cameras, calling him “an amazing man” and “one of the most powerful men” and asserting, “we will do great things for the United States.” \(It is unclear exactly whom Trump meant when he used the word “we.”\) Trump then asked Novanto to confirm that “they like me in Indonesia,” which Novanto did.

Another of the politicians who attended the lunch with Trump is Fadli Zon, the vice chairman of Indonesia’s House of Representatives, whse district includes one of the cities in which one of the Trump-branded properties will be built.[According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/donald-trump-indonesian-business-partner-wants-run-for-president/8156716), Zon is associated with a political movement seeking to unseat and jail the current governor of Jakarta, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, also known by his nickname, Ahok, and has spoken at rallies against Ahok. The anti-Ahok movement is[rooted partly in centuries of ethnic tension within the country](https://theconversation.com/how-jakartas-first-chinese-indonesian-governor-became-an-easy-target-for-radical-islamic-groups-68178): Ahok is both Christian, which has made him the target of attacks by hardline clerics claiming to represent Indonesia’s Muslim majority, and a member of the country’s historically oppressed Chinese minority,[which was the target of a massacre in 1998](http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/04/world/la-fg-indonesia-chinese-20100704). Aside from an interim governor appointed half a century ago,[Ahok is the first governor of Jakarta to fall into either category](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/world/asia/an-ethnic-chinese-christian-breaking-barriers-in-indonesia.html), and[is currently on trial for blasphemy](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-12-27/indonesia-court-to-proceed-with-blasphemy-trial-of-jakarta/8149656)for allegedly insulting the Koran, although Ahok’s supporters claim that it is Ahok’s accusers who are guilty of blasphemy for denigrating Ahok’s Christianity.

Both Trump’s question to Novanto and Zon’s presence at the meeting underscore another difficulty the president-elect introduces into the United States’ relations with Indonesia. Indonesia is both[the largest predominantly Muslim country in the world and the nation with the largest population of Muslims](http://www.pewforum.org/2015/04/02/muslims/). Novanto received significant blowback for his statement that, yes, Indonesians do like Trump, because it turns out that,[no, many Indonesians don’t like Trump](http://jakarta.coconuts.co/2015/09/07/house-members-all-kinds-hot-water-over-trump-press-conference-appearance), in large part because of his[on-again, off-again proposal](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/11/10/trump-campaign-staff-deletes-mention-of-muslim-ban-from-website/?utm_term=.a624c23af343)to ban Muslims from immigrating to the U.S.; in fact, faced with mounting criticism,[Novanto’s party apologized](http://jakarta.coconuts.co/2015/09/08/golkar-officially-apologizes-setya-novantos-trump-press-conference-appearance)not only for Novanto’s statement but also for his mere attendance at the luncheon. 

Since Trump’s victory,[both Novanto and Zon have stood up for the president-elect](http://jakarta.coconuts.co/2016/11/10/setya-novanto-and-fadli-zon-think-donald-trump-will-not-act-his-campaigns-anti-muslim), arguing that Trump’s hardline stance toward Muslim immigration was merely campaign rhetoric and not actually reflective of the president-elect’s own beliefs, something Novanto claimed Trump personally assured him was the case.  Regardless, it is clear that the Trump Organization’s planned expansion into Indonesia—which, again, is the reason Trump met with Novanto and Zon in the first place—could introduce major complications into the relationship between the president-elect and the political leaders of the world’s largest Muslim country, not to mention[a significant trade partner](https://ustr.gov/countries-regions/southeast-asia-pacific/indonesia)and[an important ally in the South China Sea region](https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2011/07/169001.htm).

As if that weren’t enough, Tanoe himself has shown increasing interest in becoming involved in Indonesian politics. In 2014, [Tanoe publicly supported the retired general Prabowo Subianto](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/donald-trumps-indonesian-business-partner-considers-running-for-president) in the nation’s presidential election; Subianto lost to the country’s current leader, Joko Widodo. Then, in 2015, he helped found a new political party, [the United Indonesia Party, or Partai Perindo](https://partaiperindo.com/) , which intends to field candidates for national office in the near future, including Tanoe himself: Shortly after _The New York Times _reported on the project, [Tanoe told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/donald-trump-indonesian-business-partner-wants-run-for-president/8156716) that, “If there is no one I can believe who can fix the problems of the country, I may try to run for president.” 

If Tanoe does so, it will create the possibility that Trump will be dealing with a head of state with whom he has shared business interests, which, [as Richard Painter told_The New York Times_](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/31/world/asia/indonesia-donald-trump-resort.html?_r=1) , “makes it impossible to conduct diplomacy in an evenhanded manner”—especially considering that, after Trump’s election, [stock in Tanoe’s company rose significantly](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/02/donald-trumps-indonesian-business-partner-considers-running-for-president) . Moreover, Tanoe, like Ahok, [is both Christian and ethnically Chinese](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-01-02/donald-trump-indonesian-business-partner-wants-run-for-president/8156716),  which some insiders consider an obstacle to his electoral chances, although Tanoe argues that it is not Ahok’s religion but his lack of firm leadership that has led to the large-scale protests against the governor. Nevertheless, if Tanoe does choose to run for office, it is difficult to see how his race, religion, and business partnership with a president-elect many see as blatantly Islamophobic could do anything other than create further difficulties both within Indonesia and in the country’s relationship with the U.S..

In other words, even though Trump’s projects in Indonesia are only in the planning phase, they have already created a remarkably complicated situation among the president-elect and politicians and businesspeople involved in the country’s political scandals and ethnic divisions. Even if Trump avoids active involvement in the decision-making process for the properties in Bali and Java, he will likely still be profiting off of them, jeopardizing his ability to appropriately interact with the nation’s leadership.

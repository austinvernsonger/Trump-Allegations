# COI - **That Emirati Businessman**

Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently [whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/02/joe-scarboroughs-latest-twitter-feud-is-just-what-the-media-doesnt-need/?utm_term=.8d0c58795e03), [video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/01/03/trump-praises-dubai-business-partner.cnn/video/playlists/atv-president-elect-donald-trump/) brought renewed scrutiny to President-elect Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a 10-minute speech given in front of the party’s 800-odd attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it.” CNN [identifies](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/01/03/trump-praises-dubai-business-partner.cnn/video/playlists/atv-president-elect-donald-trump/) Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai.” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, [defended the remarks](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/donald-trump-new-years-eve-speech/index.html) by clarifying that the president-elect and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social.”

Whether or not Hicks’s statement was true, Trump’s commendation of Sajwani is part of a pattern in which the president-elect praises his business partners in ways that suggest he has little interest in extricating himself from his company’s interests. Previously, he has name-dropped business partners in[Turkey](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/#Erdogan)and[Argentina](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/#Argentina)while on official calls with the countries’ leaders;[he also met, and took photos, with associates from India](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/#India)shortly after the election. Moreover, as with several of the countries in which Trump-branded buildings are located, the United Arab Emirates has[a questionable record on human rights](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/united-arab-emirates-revealing-the-dark-face-of-the-gulf-state-where-human-rights-abuses-are-a-daily-a6683741.html);[Human Rights Watch](https://www.hrw.org/middle-east/n-africa/united-arab-emirates)specifically states that the nation “uses its affluence to mask the government’s human-rights problems.”

By singling out Sajwani, Trump also runs headlong into accusations that he and his family are selling access to his administration through their organization and family foundations.[According to_Politico_](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/mar-a-lago-donald-trump-new-years-eve-party-233070), tickets to celebrate with the president-elect at Mar-a-Lago, went for upwards of $500; the stated attendance of at least 800 people means that the Trump Organization made at least $400,000 off of ticket sales for the event. \(There is no indication that the party was a fundraiser for any outside organization, such as a charity or campaign fund, as is often the case when politicians attend such an event.\) Whether or not the president-elect sees it as such, the event offered attendees the opportunity to be in the same room as Trump and bend his ear for a price. This follows consternation regarding[an auction for a face-to-face meeting with Trump’s daughter, Ivanka](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/16/us/politics/ivanka-trump-charity-auction.html), and[a charity event that offered a reception with the president-elect and a hunting trip with his two sons](http://www.politico.com/blogs/donald-trump-administration/2016/12/trump-family-fundraiser-inauguration-232829), both of which have since been cancelled, as well as ongoing speculation that[foreign entities will attempt to curry favor with Trump by booking rooms and events at his hotel in Washington, D.C](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/01/donald-trump-conflicts-of-interests/508382/#DC-Hotel). That Trump singled out Sajwani at the New Year’s Eve party lends credence to these concerns—it’s an instance of someone receiving the president-elect’s attention simply by buying a ticket to one of his events.

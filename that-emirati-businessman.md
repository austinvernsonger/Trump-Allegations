# COI - **That Emirati Businessman**

Though the biggest controversy over the New Year’s Eve celebration at Mar-a-Lago, Trump’s Florida estate, was apparently [whether or not Joe Scarborough could accurately be described as having “partied” there](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/02/joe-scarboroughs-latest-twitter-feud-is-just-what-the-media-doesnt-need/?utm_term=.8d0c58795e03), [video footage taken by a guest and obtained by CNN the next day](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/01/03/trump-praises-dubai-business-partner.cnn/video/playlists/atv-president-elect-donald-trump/) brought renewed scrutiny to President-elect Donald Trump’s own presence at the event. During a 10-minute speech given in front of the party’s 800-odd attendees, Trump praised his Emirati business partner Hussain Sajwani and Sajwani’s family, saying, “The most beautiful people from Dubai are here tonight, and they’re seeing it and they love it.” CNN [identifies](http://www.cnn.com/videos/tv/2017/01/03/trump-praises-dubai-business-partner.cnn/video/playlists/atv-president-elect-donald-trump/) Sajwani as a “billionaire developer in Dubai” who has “paid Trump millions of dollars to license the Trump name for golf courses in Dubai.” Trump’s spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, [defended the remarks](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/02/politics/donald-trump-new-years-eve-speech/index.html) by clarifying that the president-elect and Sajwani “had no formal meetings of professional discussions. Their interactions were social.”

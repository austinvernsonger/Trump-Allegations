## Part 1

Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016 sources A and B, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and a former top level Russian intelligence officer still active inside the Kremlin respectively, the Russian authorities had been cultivating and supporting US Republican presidential candidate, Donald TRUMP for at least 5 years. Source B asserted  that the TRUMP operation was both supported and directed by Russian President Vladimir PUTIN. 

Its aim was to sow discord and Transatlantic alliance which was viewed as inimical to Russia's interests. source C, a senior Russian financial official said the TRUMP operation should be seen in terms of PUTIN's desire to return to Nineteenth Century 'Great Power' politics anchored upon countries' interests rather than the ideals-based international order established after World War Two. S/he had overheard PUTIN talking in this way to close associates on several occasions.



## Part 2

In terms of specifics, Source A confided that the Kremlin had been feeding TRUMP and his team valuable intelligence on his opponents, including Democratic presidential candidate Hillary CLINTON, for several years \(see more below\). This was confirmed by Source D, a close associate of TRUMP who had organized and managed his recent trips to Moscow, and who reported, also in June 2016, that this Russian intelligence had been "very helpful". The Kremlin's cultivation operation on TRUMP also had comprised offering him various lucrative real estate development business deals in Russia, especially in relation to the ongoing 2018 World Cup soccer tournament. However, so far, for reasons unknown, TRUMP had not taken up any of these.



## Part 3

However, there were other aspects to TRUMP's engagement with the

Russian authorities. One which had borne fruit for them was to exploit

TRUMP's personal obsessions and sexual perversion in order to obtain

suitable 'kompromat' \(compromising material\) on him. According to

Source D, wheres/he had been present, TRUMP's \(perverted\) conduct in

Moscow included hiring the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton Hotel,

where he knew President and Mrs OBAMA \(whom he hated\) had stayed

on one of their official trips to Russia, and defiling the bed where they had

slept by employing a number of prostitutes to perform a 'golden showers'

\(urination\) show in front of him. The hotel was known to be under FSB

control with microphones and concealed cameras in all the main rooms

to record anything they wanted to.





## Part 4

The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above

confirmed by Source E, &lt;=========REDACTED================&gt;

who said thats/he and several of the staff were aware of it at t e time

and subsequently. S/he believed it had happened in 2013. Source E

provided an introduction for a company ethnic Russian operative to

Source F, a female staffer at the hotel when TRUMP had stayed there, who

also confirmed the story. Speaking separately in June 2016, Source B \(the

former top level Russian intelligence officer\) asserted that TRUMP's

unorthodox behavior in Russia over the years had provided the

authorities there with enough embarrassing material on the now

Republican presidential candidate to be able to blackmail him if they so

wished.



## Part 5



Asked about the Kremlin's reported intelligence feed to TRUMP over recent years and rumours about a Russian dossier of 'kompromat' on Hillary CLINTON \(being circulated\), Source 8 confirmed the file's existence. S/he confided in a trusted compatriot that it had been collated by Department K of the FSB for many years, dating back to her husband Bill's presidency, and comprised mainly eavesdropped conversations of various sorts rather than details/evidence of unorthodox or embarrassing behavior. Some of the conversations were from bugged comments CLINTON had made on her various trips to Russia and focused on things she had said which contradicted her current position on various issues. Others were most probably from phone intercepts.



## Part 6

Continuing on this theme, Source G, a senior Kremlin official, confided that the CLINTON dossier was controlled exclusively by chief Kremlin spokesman, Dmitriy PESKOV, who was responsible for compiling/handling it on the explicit instructions of PUTIN himself. The dossier however had not as yet been made available abroad, including to TRUMP or his campaign team. At present it was unclear what PUTIN's intentions were in this regard.
